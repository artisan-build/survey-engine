# Survey Engine

This is the application that [Artisan Build](https://artisan.build) uses to administer surveys. We have made it open source primarily in the interest of transparency. Some of the surveys we administer ask sensitive or controversial questions and we want our respondents to feel confident that they can answer honestly without fear of their answers being made public.
